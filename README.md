IRSI Project
Overview
The IRSI Project involves an analysis of a flower dataset focusing on sepal and petal dimensions. This project demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis and visualization.

Data
The dataset contains information about different flower species with the following features:

Sepal Length: Measurement of the sepal length in centimeters.
Sepal Width: Measurement of the sepal width in centimeters.
Petal Length: Measurement of the petal length in centimeters.
Petal Width: Measurement of the petal width in centimeters.
Analysis
In this project, the following analyses were performed:

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics of sepal and petal dimensions.
Data Visualization: Various plots to explore relationships and distributions, including scatter plots and pair plots.
Feature Exploration: Analysis of the correlation between different flower features.
Results
The analysis provides insights into the distribution and relationships of flower features, which can be useful for understanding flower characteristics and patterns
